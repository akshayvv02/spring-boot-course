## 🧠 Spring Boot Core Java Recap: Object-Oriented Programming in Java

### 🎯 Key Concepts Covered:

* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) mindset
* Real-world analogies for objects
* Properties (state) and behaviors (actions) of objects
* Class as a blueprint for creating objects
* Role of JVM in object creation
* Importance of design-thinking in OOP

---

### ✅ Object-Oriented Thinking

Java is **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** language, which means:

> Everything is modeled as an **object**, and every object:
>
> * **Knows something** → *Properties / State*
> * **Does something** → *Behaviors / Methods*

#### 🔍 Real-world Analogy

| Object | Properties (What it knows) | Behaviors (What it does)                |
| ------ | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Pen    | color, height, brand       | writes                                  |
| Remote | size, button count, brand  | changes channels, powers devices on/off |
| Human  | name, age, skills          | talks, walks, codes                     |

This way of thinking should be applied even before writing code. **Think in terms of objects first**, e.g., for a simple task like adding two numbers, design a class or object responsible for that task.

---

### 🏗️ Class and Object

* **Object**: Instance of a class; represents a real-world entity with state and behavior.
* **Class**: Blueprint or template that defines properties and behaviors.

> **You cannot create an object without a class.**

#### 🧰 Real-world Example:

If a **table** is an object:

* It is **created by a carpenter**.
* The carpenter follows a **blueprint/design** for dimensions, height, material, etc.

##### In Java terms:

| Real World   | Java Equivalent               |
| ------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Table        | Object                        |
| Blueprint    | Class                         |
| Carpenter    | JVM                           |
| Design specs | Fields and methods in a class |

---

### 🧠 Who Creates the Object?

* In **real life**, a carpenter creates the object.
* In **Java**, the **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)** creates the object using:

  * A `.class` file (compiled version of `.java` class)
  * That file acts as the **blueprint**

So, JVM is your **object factory**, but **you** need to design the class first.

---

### 🧾 Summary

* Think of **everything as objects**.
* Every object has **properties (data members)** and **behaviors (methods)**.
* **Classes** are templates that describe these properties and behaviors.
* The **JVM** is responsible for turning class blueprints into actual objects.
* OOP is not just about syntax — it’s about **modeling your domain logically**.

---

## 📌 Java Class–Object Flow

```java
// Blueprint: Class
public class Pen {
    String color;
    String brand;

    void write() {
        System.out.println("Writing...");
    }
}

// Object creation
Pen myPen = new Pen(); // JVM creates object here
myPen.color = "Blue";
myPen.write(); // Output: Writing...
```

---

## 👨‍💼 Interview Questions and Answers

### ❓ Q1: What is Object-Oriented Programming, and how does Java support it?

**Answer:**
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around **objects**—entities that contain data (fields) and behaviors (methods). Java supports OOP through four key principles:

1. **Encapsulation** – Binding data and methods together
2. **Inheritance** – One class can inherit features from another
3. **Polymorphism** – Methods can behave differently based on the object
4. **Abstraction** – Hiding internal implementation and showing only relevant details

Java enforces OOP by requiring even the simplest logic to be encapsulated within a class.

---

### ❓ Q2: How is a class different from an object in Java?

**Answer:**
A **class** is a blueprint or template that defines the **structure and behavior** of objects.
An **object** is an actual instance of a class created at runtime, residing in memory, and capable of holding its own state and behavior.

---

### ❓ Q3: Can you explain the role of the JVM in object creation?

**Answer:**
The **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)** is responsible for executing compiled `.class` files. When the `new` keyword is used in Java, the JVM:

1. Loads the class (if not already loaded)
2. Allocates memory for the object
3. Initializes the object via constructor
4. Returns a reference to that object

The **JVM acts like the "carpenter"** that builds objects based on your class blueprint.

---

### ❓ Q4: Why is it important to think in terms of objects before writing Java code?

**Answer:**
Thinking in terms of objects helps model real-world problems more naturally and makes code **modular, reusable, and maintainable**. It ensures that logic is **encapsulated within appropriate entities**, leading to better software design and testability.

---

### ❓ Q5: How would you explain "behavior" and "state" in Java?

**Answer:**

* **State**: The values of an object’s attributes at a particular time (fields/properties)
* **Behavior**: The actions that an object can perform (methods)

E.g., a `Car` class:

```java
String color; // state
void drive() { ... } // behavior
```

## 🔧 Java OOP in Action — Creating Classes, Objects, and Methods

### 🔹 What was implemented

* Created a **`Calculator` class** to represent the *design* (blueprint).
* Defined a method inside the class: `add(int n1, int n2)` → returns `n1 + n2`
* Created an object of the class using `new Calculator()`
* Called the method using the object reference and passed values from the main class.

### 🔹 Code Breakdown

```java
class Calculator {
    int add(int n1, int n2) {
        return n1 + n2;
    }
}

public class Demo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num1 = 4;
        int num2 = 5;

        Calculator calc = new Calculator();     // Object creation
        int result = calc.add(num1, num2);      // Method call
        System.out.println(result);             // Output: 9
    }
}
```

---

### ⚙️ Key Concepts

* **Method Declaration:**

  ```java
  public int add(int n1, int n2)
  ```

  * `public`: accessible from anywhere
  * `int`: return type
  * `add`: method name
  * `(int n1, int n2)`: parameters (passed during method call)

* **Object Creation Syntax:**

  ```java
  Calculator calc = new Calculator();
  ```

  * `Calculator`: Class type
  * `calc`: Reference variable (points to the object)
  * `new`: Allocates memory (asks JVM to construct object)
  * `Calculator()`: Calls the constructor (default, in this case)

---

### 💡 Notes for Developers

* Always keep **logic separated**: write reusable logic in classes, not directly in `main()`.
* Avoid **hardcoding** values; use variables and method parameters.
* A **class is a design**, and an **object is the usable instance**.
* Java is **statically typed**—specify types for variables, method return values, etc.

---

## ✅ Interview Q\&A

### ❓ Q1: How do you create an object in Java?

**A:** Use `new` keyword with class name:

```java
Calculator calc = new Calculator();
```

This allocates memory and returns a reference.

---

### ❓ Q2: Why can't we call `add()` directly without an object?

**A:** Because `add()` is an instance method (non-static), and it belongs to a different class. To call it, you need an object of that class.

---

### ❓ Q3: What is the difference between primitive and reference types in Java?

**A:**

* **Primitive types** (e.g., `int`, `float`) store actual values.
* **Reference types** (e.g., `Calculator`) store a reference (memory address) to the object.

---

### ❓ Q4: Why should logic be inside methods/classes and not `main()`?

**A:** Helps achieve separation of concerns, promotes reuse, and keeps the `main()` method clean and readable.

## ⚙️ Java Internals: JDK vs JRE vs JVM

### 🔹 Core Components

| Component | Full Form                | Purpose                                                                |
| --------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **JDK**   | Java Development Kit     | Provides tools to develop, compile, and debug Java programs            |
| **JRE**   | Java Runtime Environment | Provides environment and libraries to run Java applications            |
| **JVM**   | Java Virtual Machine     | Executes the compiled bytecode on any platform (platform independence) |

---

### 🛠️ How Java Code Executes

1. **You write Java code** → `.java` file
2. **JDK compiles** it to → `.class` (bytecode)
3. **JVM runs the bytecode** inside the **JRE**

   * JVM is platform-specific but hides OS-level differences
4. **JRE provides** core libraries and runtime classes used by JVM

---

### 📦 Relationship Diagram

```
JDK
├── JRE
│   ├── JVM
│   └── Core Libraries
├── Compiler (javac)
├── Debugger, tools, etc.
```

* Installing **JDK** = You get **JRE + JVM + dev tools**
* Installing **JRE only** = You can run Java programs, but not compile them

---

### 🧑‍💻 Developer Notes

* You need **JDK** to *write and compile* Java code.
* End-users only need **JRE** to *run* Java applications.
* **JVM ensures portability**: Write once, run anywhere.

---

## ✅ Interview Q\&A

### ❓ Q1: What is the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM?

**A:**

* **JDK** is for development (includes compiler, debugger, JRE).
* **JRE** is for runtime (includes JVM + libraries).
* **JVM** executes Java bytecode on the machine.

---

### ❓ Q2: Why is Java considered platform-independent?

**A:** Because the compiled bytecode runs on the **JVM**, which is available on all platforms. The source code is written once and can run anywhere there's a JVM.

---

### ❓ Q3: What happens when you run a Java program?

**A:**

1. JDK compiles `.java` to `.class`
2. JVM loads and verifies the bytecode
3. Bytecode is interpreted or JIT-compiled and executed by JVM

---

## 🔁 Java Method Overloading Explained

### 🔹 What is Method Overloading?

Method Overloading = **Same method name**, **different parameter list**

This enables you to define **multiple variants** of a method to handle **different types or counts of input**.

---

### 🔹 Examples

```java
class Calculator {
    // Add two integers
    public int add(int n1, int n2) {
        return n1 + n2;
    }

    // Add three integers
    public int add(int n1, int n2, int n3) {
        return n1 + n2 + n3;
    }

    // Add two doubles
    public double add(double n1, double n2) {
        return n1 + n2;
    }
}
```

---

### 🔹 Key Points

| Feature                    | Overloading Supported?                                |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Same name                  | ✅ Yes                                                 |
| Different # params         | ✅ Yes                                                 |
| Different types            | ✅ Yes                                                 |
| Different return type only | ❌ No (return type is ignored for overload resolution) |

* **Overloading = Compile-time polymorphism**
* Improves readability and avoids redundant naming like `addTwoNumbers()`, `addThreeNumbers()`

---

## ✅ Interview Q\&A

### ❓ Q1: What is method overloading?

**A:** Method overloading allows a class to have multiple methods with the **same name but different parameter lists** (type, number, or order). It enables flexible method usage for different inputs.

---

### ❓ Q2: Can you overload methods by changing only the return type?

**A:** **No.** The return type is not considered during method signature resolution. Overloaded methods must differ by **parameters only**.

---

### ❓ Q3: How is overloading different from overriding?

**A:**

* **Overloading**: Same class, compile-time polymorphism, based on parameters.
* **Overriding**: Different classes (parent-child), runtime polymorphism, based on behavior change.

---

### ❓ Q4: Why is method overloading useful in real-world applications?

**A:** It provides cleaner APIs and **flexibility**. E.g., a logging utility might offer:

```java
log(String msg)
log(String msg, Exception e)
log(String msg, Level level)
```

Same method name, adapted to various scenarios.

---

## 🧠 Java Memory Model (JVM Internals)

### 🔹 Inside the JVM

When Java runs your program, the **JVM allocates memory in two main areas**:

| Memory Area | Purpose                                                                 |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Stack**   | Stores **method frames**, **local variables**, **reference variables**  |
| **Heap**    | Stores **objects** and their **instance variables** (non-static fields) |

---

### 🧱 Memory Visualization

```plaintext
JDK
└── JRE
    └── JVM
        ├── Stack (per-thread)
        │   ├── main() frame: int data, Calculator obj, int r1
        │   ├── add() frame: int n1, int n2
        └── Heap (shared)
            ├── Calculator object 1 (obj) → num = 5
            └── Calculator object 2 (obj1) → num = 5
```

---

### 🔹 Stack Details

* **Each method call** creates a new **stack frame**.
* Variables like `n1`, `n2`, `r1`, `data`, `obj`, `obj1` are **local** and exist in the stack.
* When a method finishes, its **stack frame is removed**.

---

### 🔹 Heap Details

* **Objects** (created via `new`) are stored in **heap**.
* Each object stores:

  * **Instance variables** (e.g., `num`)
  * A **reference** to method definitions (but execution still happens in stack)
* Objects have **addresses** (e.g., `0x101`, `0x105`) which are stored in stack via reference variables.

---

### 🔹 Code Behavior Demo

```java
class Calculator {
    int num = 5;

    int add(int n1, int n2) {
        return n1 + n2;
    }
}

public class Demo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calculator obj = new Calculator();
        Calculator obj1 = new Calculator();

        obj.num = 8;

        System.out.println(obj.num);   // Output: 8
        System.out.println(obj1.num);  // Output: 5
    }
}
```

🧠 **Why?**
Because `obj` and `obj1` are **separate objects in heap**, updating one does not affect the other.

---

## ✅ Interview Q\&A

### ❓ Q1: Where are local variables stored in Java?

**A:** Local variables are stored in the **stack**, within the method’s stack frame.

---

### ❓ Q2: Where are instance variables stored?

**A:** Inside the **heap**, as part of the object’s memory.

---

### ❓ Q3: What happens when you call a method?

**A:** A new **stack frame** is created in the stack. After method execution, the frame is **popped off**.

---

### ❓ Q4: What is the difference between a reference variable and an object?

**A:** The **reference variable** (e.g., `obj`) is stored in stack and holds the address of the **actual object**, which resides in heap.

---

### ❓ Q5: Are multiple objects with the same structure independent?

**A:** Yes. Even if they have the same class structure, each `new` object lives in its own **heap space**. Modifying one does **not** affect the other.

---

## 🧾 Understanding `toString()` in Java Classes

### 🔹 What is `toString()`?

`toString()` is a method defined in the base class `java.lang.Object`. It returns a **string representation** of the object. Every Java class **inherits** it by default.

```java
public String toString()
```

---

### 🔍 Default Behavior

If you don't override `toString()`, calling it on an object gives this:

```java
Calculator obj = new Calculator();
System.out.println(obj); // Output: Calculator@1a2b3c
```

This default output is:

* Class name
* `@`
* Hexadecimal representation of the object's hash code

➡️ Not human-readable or useful in most cases.

---

### ✨ Why Override `toString()`?

* To provide a **meaningful string representation** of the object
* Useful for **debugging**, **logging**, or **printing object data**

---

### 🧑‍💻 Example

```java
class Calculator {
    int num;

    Calculator(int num) {
        this.num = num;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Calculator with num = " + num;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calculator calc = new Calculator(10);
        System.out.println(calc); // Output: Calculator with num = 10
    }
}
```

---

### 🧠 Developer Tip

Any time you write a POJO (e.g., in Spring Boot: `@Entity`, `@Component`, etc.), **override `toString()`** for clean logs or better inspection in tests.

---

## ✅ Interview Q\&A

### ❓ Q1: What is the purpose of `toString()` in Java?

**A:** It provides a string representation of the object. It’s often overridden to return a more readable or useful output than the default `ClassName@hashcode`.

---

### ❓ Q2: What is the output of `System.out.println(object)` if `toString()` is not overridden?

**A:** It prints the object's class name followed by `@` and its hash code in hexadecimal.

---

### ❓ Q3: Is it a good practice to override `toString()`? Why?

**A:** Yes. Especially when debugging or logging, a meaningful `toString()` helps trace object state clearly.

---

## 🔁 `for-each` Loop in Java

### 🔹 What is it?

The **`for-each` loop** (also called the **enhanced `for` loop**) is used to **iterate over arrays or collections** in a more readable way than traditional `for` loops.

---

### 🔹 Syntax

```java
for (type var : collection) {
    // use var
}
```

### ✅ Example with Array:

```java
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4};
for (int num : numbers) {
    System.out.println(num);
}
```

### ✅ Example with List:

```java
List<String> names = List.of("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");
for (String name : names) {
    System.out.println(name);
}
```

---

### ⚠️ Key Characteristics

* **Read-only**: You *cannot* modify the collection using a for-each loop.
* **No index access**: If you need an index, use a regular `for` loop.
* Works with **arrays**, **Collections** (e.g., List, Set), **Iterable** types.

---

### 🧠 When to Use

✅ Use `for-each` when:

* You don’t need the index.
* You are only *reading* values.

🚫 Avoid if:

* You need to *remove elements* while iterating (use `Iterator` instead).
* You need to modify the list or access by index.

---

## ✅ Interview Q\&A

### ❓ Q1: What is a `for-each` loop used for in Java?

**A:** To iterate over arrays or collections without using an index or iterator manually. It simplifies iteration when you only need to read elements.

---

### ❓ Q2: Can you modify the list inside a `for-each` loop?

**A:** No, modifying or removing elements (like calling `list.remove()`) inside a `for-each` loop throws `ConcurrentModificationException`. Use an `Iterator` instead.

---

### ❓ Q3: What is the difference between a traditional `for` loop and a `for-each` loop?

**A:**

| Traditional `for`     | `for-each`                     |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Has index access      | No index access                |
| Can modify list/array | Read-only iteration            |
| More flexible         | More concise, less error-prone |

---

## 🧵 Java Strings – Immutable by Design

### 🔹 Key Concept

Java `String` objects are **immutable** — once created, their value **cannot be changed**.

```java
String name = "Navin";
name = name + " Reddy"; // Creates a *new* String object
```

Here, `"Navin Reddy"` is **not modifying** `"Navin"`; instead, a **new object** is created in memory.

---

### 🔹 String Memory Handling

Java uses a **String Constant Pool** (SCP) within the heap for efficiency.

```java
String s1 = "Navin";
String s2 = "Navin";
System.out.println(s1 == s2); // true — same object in SCP
```

* SCP stores **unique string literals**.
* Reuses existing strings if the literal already exists.
* If you concatenate or alter a string, **new object** is created.

---

### 🔹 Immutability in Action

```java
String name = "Navin";     // stored in SCP
name = name + " Reddy";    // new object "Navin Reddy" created
```

* The original `"Navin"` string is untouched.
* The reference `name` now points to a **new string**.
* The old object becomes **eligible for garbage collection**.

---

## 🔐 Mutable Strings

When you **need to change string content without creating new objects**, use:

### 🔸 `StringBuilder` (Not Thread-Safe)

### 🔸 `StringBuffer` (Thread-Safe)

```java
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Navin");
sb.append(" Reddy");
System.out.println(sb); // Navin Reddy (same object modified)
```

---

## ✅ Interview Q\&A

### ❓ Q1: Are Strings mutable in Java?

**A:** No. Strings are **immutable**. Every modification creates a new object.

---

### ❓ Q2: What is the String Constant Pool?

**A:** A special memory region in the heap where **unique string literals** are stored and reused to save memory.

---

### ❓ Q3: What's the difference between `String`, `StringBuilder`, and `StringBuffer`?

| Type            | Mutable? | Thread-Safe?  |
| --------------- | -------- | ------------- |
| `String`        | ❌        | ✅ (immutable) |
| `StringBuilder` | ✅        | ❌             |
| `StringBuffer`  | ✅        | ✅             |

---

### ❓ Q4: How does Java optimize memory with Strings?

**A:** Java stores string literals in the **String Constant Pool** and reuses them if the content is the same.

---

## 🧵 `StringBuffer` in Java

### 🔹 What is `StringBuffer`?

* A **mutable sequence of characters**
* Part of `java.lang` package
* Unlike `String`, you can **modify** its contents (append, insert, delete)
* **Thread-safe** (synchronized methods)

---

### 🔹 Key Properties

| Property                     | Description                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Mutable                      | Can change content without creating a new object |
| Thread-safe                  | Suitable for multithreaded environments          |
| Default capacity             | 16 characters (unless initialized with a string) |
| Capacity increases as needed | To reduce reallocation overhead                  |

---

### 🔹 Important Methods

```java
StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("Navin");

// Append
sb.append(" Reddy");          // Navin Reddy

// Insert
sb.insert(0, "Java ");        // Java Navin Reddy

// Delete
sb.deleteCharAt(2);           // Jaav Navin Reddy

// Substring
String sub = sb.substring(5, 10); // Navin

// Set length
sb.setLength(30);             // Adds null chars after actual content

// Ensure capacity
sb.ensureCapacity(100);       // Sets min capacity to 100

// Convert to String
String finalStr = sb.toString();
```

---

### 🔹 Capacity vs Length

```java
StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("Navin");

System.out.println(sb.length());    // 5
System.out.println(sb.capacity());  // 21 (5 + 16 extra buffer)
```

---

## 🔄 `StringBuffer` vs `StringBuilder` vs `String`

| Feature     | `String`        | `StringBuffer`            | `StringBuilder`                |
| ----------- | --------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Mutable     | ❌ No            | ✅ Yes                     | ✅ Yes                          |
| Thread-safe | ✅ Yes           | ✅ Yes                     | ❌ No                           |
| Performance | Slow (GC heavy) | Slower (synchronized)     | Faster (non-thread-safe)       |
| Use case    | Constant string | Multi-threaded mutability | Single-threaded mutable string |

---

## ✅ Interview Q\&A

### ❓ Q1: Why use `StringBuffer` over `String`?

**A:** `StringBuffer` is mutable, which means you can modify its contents without creating new objects—more memory-efficient in cases of frequent string manipulation.

---

### ❓ Q2: How is `StringBuffer` different from `StringBuilder`?

**A:** Both are mutable, but:

* `StringBuffer` is **thread-safe** (synchronized)
* `StringBuilder` is **not** thread-safe but faster in single-threaded code

---

### ❓ Q3: What is the default capacity of `StringBuffer`?

**A:** 16 characters. If initialized with a string, capacity becomes `16 + str.length()`.

---

## 🧷 `static` Keyword in Java — Variables

### 🔹 What Is `static`?

The `static` keyword in Java denotes that **a member (variable/method)** belongs to the **class itself**, not to any individual object.

---

### 📦 Example – Without and With `static`

```java
class Mobile {
    String brand;
    int price;
    static String name = "SmartPhone";  // Shared across all instances

    public void show() {
        System.out.println(brand + " : " + price + " : " + name);
    }
}
```

```java
public class Demo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Mobile obj1 = new Mobile();
        obj1.brand = "Apple";
        obj1.price = 1500;

        Mobile obj2 = new Mobile();
        obj2.brand = "Samsung";
        obj2.price = 1700;

        obj1.show();  // Apple : 1500 : SmartPhone
        obj2.show();  // Samsung : 1700 : SmartPhone

        obj1.name = "Phone"; // Modifies shared variable

        obj1.show();  // Apple : 1500 : Phone
        obj2.show();  // Samsung : 1700 : Phone
    }
}
```

### 🧠 Key Points

* `static` variables are:

  * **Stored once per class** (not per object)
  * **Shared among all objects**
* Can be accessed using **ClassName**:

  ```java
  Mobile.name = "Phone";
  ```
* Can also be accessed with objects, but **not recommended**.

### 💡 Memory Behavior in JVM

| Variable Type     | Memory Location              | Unique per object? |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Instance Variable | Heap                         | ✅ Yes              |
| Static Variable   | **Method Area / Class Area** | ❌ No – shared      |

## ✅ Interview Q\&A

### ❓ Q1: What does the `static` keyword do in Java?

**A:** It makes the variable or method a **class-level** member—shared across all instances.

---

### ❓ Q2: Can you access static variables via object reference?

**A:** Yes, but it's **discouraged**. Best practice is to access using the **class name**.

---

### ❓ Q3: Why would you use a static variable?

**A:** When a variable’s value is **common for all objects**, e.g., `PI`, configuration flags, constants, etc. This also saves memory.

---

### ❓ Q4: Can static methods access instance variables?

**A:** **No**, because static methods belong to the class and are not tied to any instance. We'll explore this in the next topic.
